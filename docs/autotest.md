# Automated testing

## Unit testing and code quality

Use the `make test` command.

## QEMU and Kubernetes

E2E testing relies on a cluster running inside multiple QEMU virtual
machines deployed by [GoVM](https://github.com/govm-project/govm). The
same cluster can also be used interactively when real hardware is not
available.

E2E testing is known to work on a Linux development host system. The user
must be allowed to use Docker.

KVM must be enabled. Usually this is the case when `/dev/kvm` exists.
The current user does not need the privileges to use KVM and QEMU
doesn't have to be installed because GoVM will run QEMU inside a
container with root privileges.

Note that cloud providers often don't offer KVM support on their
regular machines. Search for "nested virtualization" for your provider
to determine whether and how it supports KVM.

Nested virtualization is also needed when using Kata Containers inside
the cluster. On Intel-based machines it can be enabled by loading the
`kvm_intel` module with `nested=1` (see
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/KVM#Nested_virtualization). At
this time, Kata Containers up to and including 1.9.1 is [not
compatible with
PMEM-CSI](https://github.com/intel/pmem-csi/issues/303) because
volumes are not passed in as PMEM, but Kata Containers [can be
installed](https://github.com/kata-containers/packaging/tree/master/kata-deploy#kubernetes-quick-start)
and used for applications that are not using PMEM.

PMEM-CSI images must have been created and published in some Docker
registry, as described earlier in [build PMEM-CSI](DEVELOPMENT.md#build-pmem-csi).
In addition, that registry must be accessible from inside the
cluster. That works for the default (a local registry in the build
host) but may require setting additional [configuration
options](#configuration-options) for other scenarios.

## Starting and stopping a test cluster

`make start` will bring up a Kubernetes test cluster inside four QEMU
virtual machines.
The first node is the Kubernetes master without
persistent memory.
The other three nodes are worker nodes with one emulated 32GB NVDIMM each.
After the cluster has been formed, `make start` installs [NFD](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/stable/get-started/index.html) to label
the worker nodes. The PMEM-CSI driver can be installed with
`test/setup-deployment.sh`, but will also be installed as needed by
the E2E test suite.

Once `make start` completes, the cluster is ready for interactive use via
`kubectl` inside the virtual machine. Alternatively, you can also
set `KUBECONFIG` as shown at the end of the `make start` output
and use `kubectl` binary on the host running VMs.

Use `make stop` to stop and remove the virtual machines.

`make restart` can be used to cleanly reboot all virtual
machines. This is useful during development after a `make push-images`
to ensure that the cluster runs those rebuilt images. However, for
that to work the image pull policy has to be changed from the default
"if not present" to "always" by setting the `TEST_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY`
environment variable to `Always`.

## Running commands on test cluster nodes over ssh

`make start` generates ssh wrapper scripts `_work/pmem-govm/ssh.N` for each
test cluster node which are handy for running a single command or to
start an interactive shell. Examples:

`_work/pmem-govm/ssh.0 kubectl get pods` runs a kubectl command on
the master node.

`_work/pmem-govm/ssh.1` starts a shell on the first worker node.

## Deploying PMEM-CSI on a test cluster

After `make start`, PMEM-CSI is *not* installed yet. Either install
manually as [described for a normal
cluster](install.md#installation-and-setup) or use the
[setup-deployment.sh](/test/setup-deployment.sh) script.

## Configuration options

Several aspects of the cluster and build setup can be configured by overriding
the settings in the [test-config.sh](/test/test-config.sh) file. See
that file for a description of all options. Options can be set as
environment variables of `make start` on a case-by-case basis or
permanently by creating a file like `test/test-config.d/my-config.sh`.

Multiple different clusters can be brought up in parallel by changing
the default `pmem-govm` cluster name via the `CLUSTER` env variable.

For example, this invocation sets up a cluster using an older release
of Kubernetes:

``` 
TEST_KUBERNETES_VERSION=1.18 CLUSTER=kubernetes-1.18 make start
```

See additional details in [test/test-config.d](/test/test-config.d).

## Running E2E tests

`make test_e2e` will run [csi-test
sanity](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/csi-test/tree/master/pkg/sanity)
tests and some [Kubernetes storage
tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test/e2e/storage/testsuites)
against the PMEM-CSI driver.

When [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) is installed, then it
can be used to run individual tests and to control additional aspects
of the test run. For example, to run just the E2E provisioning test
(create PVC, write data in one pod, read it in another) in verbose mode:

``` console
$ KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/_work/pmem-govm/kube.config REPO_ROOT=$(pwd) ginkgo -v -focus=pmem-csi.*should.provision.storage.with.defaults ./test/e2e/
Nov 26 11:21:28.805: INFO: The --provider flag is not set.  Treating as a conformance test.  Some tests may not be run.

It is also possible to run just the sanity tests until one of them fails:

``` console

...
```

## Testing on an existing cluster

This can be done by emulating what `make start` does when setting up a
QEMU-based cluster. Here is a (not necessarily complete) list:
- Prepare a directory outside of `_work` with the following files.
- Create `ssh.<0 to number of nodes -1>` scripts such that each script
  logs into the corresponding node or executes commands. For example:
``` console
$ cat igk/ssh.0
#!/bin/sh

ssh igk-1 "$@"
```
- Create `ssh.<host name>` symlinks to the corresponding `ssh.<number>` file.
- Create a `kubernetes.version` file with `<major>.<minor>` versions, for example 1.19.
- Create `kube.config` and ensure that a local kubectl command can use it
  to connect to the cluster. SSH portforwarding may be necessary for remote
  clusters. The config must grant admin permissions.
- Ensure that `ssh.<number> <command>` works for the following commands:
  - `kubectl get nodes` (only needed for `ssh.0`)
  - `sudo pvs`
  - `sudo ndctl list -NR`
- Label all worker nodes with PMEM with `storage=pmem` and
  `feature.node.kubernetes.io/memory-nv.dax=true`.
- Delete all namespaces.
- On OpenShift 4.6 and 4.7: create the `scheduler-policy` config map with a fixed
  host port (default: `TEST_SCHEDULER_EXTENDER_NODE_PORT=32000`) and reconfigure
  `scheduler/cluster` as explained
  in [OpenShift scheduler configuration](install.md#openshift-scheduler-configuration).
  There is one crucial difference for the config map: in the `managedResources` array,
  it must also include an entry for `second.pmem-csi.intel.com/scheduler` (use by
  operator-lvm-production). The corresponding service will be created when deploying
  PMEM-CSI as part of the tests.
- Symlink `_work/<cluster>` to the directory.
- Push a pmem-csi-driver image to a registry that the cluster can pull from.
  The normal `make push-images` and `make test_e2e` work when overriding the test config
  with a `test/test-config.d/xxx_external-cluster.sh` file that has the following content.
  This is just an example, quay.io also works.
```
TEST_LOCAL_REGISTRY=docker.io/pohly
TEST_PMEM_REGISTRY=docker.io/pohly
TEST_BUILD_PMEM_REGISTRY=docker.io/pohly
TEST_LOCAL_REGISTRY_SKIP_TLS=false
```
- Run `CLUSTER=<cluster> TEST_HAVE_OLM=false make test_e2e TEST_E2E_SKIP="raw.conversion"`. On OpenShift,
  use `TEST_HAVE_OLM=true`. The only direct TCP connection is the one for the API server,
  so with port forwarding a single developer machine can test multiple different remote
  clusters.

## Using ndctl on an OS which does not provide it

If `ndctl` is not available for the OS but containers can be run, then
the following workaround is possible. Create a wrapper script:
``` ShellSession
sudo tee /usr/local/bin/ndctl <<EOF
#!/bin/sh

podman run --privileged -u 0:0 --rm docker.io/intel/pmem-csi-driver:v1.0.2 ndctl "\$@"
EOF
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/ndctl
```

Then ensure that `sudo ndctl` finds the wrapper there:
``` ShellSession
sudo sed -i -e 's;\(secure_path.*\);\1:/usr/local/bin;' /etc/sudoers
```
