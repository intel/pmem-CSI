# Scheduler

This directory contains the implementation of a [scheduler
extender](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/scheduling/scheduler_extender.md).
It is meant to be linked into the PMEM-CSI master controller because
that is where we know about nodes and can get their current capacity.
