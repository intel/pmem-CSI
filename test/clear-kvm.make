# A registry on the build host (i.e. localhost:5000) is marked

# The latest upstream Kubernetes binaries are used because that way
# the resulting installation is always up-to-date. Some workarounds
# in systemd units are necessary to get that up and running.

# - a single node with the master taint removed
# - networking managed by kubelet itself
#
# Kubernetes does not get started by default because it might
# not always be needed in the image, depending on the test.
# _work/kube-clear-kvm can be used to start it.
