# The container runtime that is meant to be used inside Clear Linux.
# Possible values are "docker" and "crio".
#
# Docker is the default for two reasons:
# - survives killing the VMs while cri-o doesn't (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-o/issues/1742#issuecomment-442384980)
# - Docker mounts /sys read/write while cri-o read-only. pmem-csi needs it in writable state.

# as NAT gateway. Even numbers are for the guests (.2, .4, ...).

# IP addresses of DNS servers to use inside the VMs, separated by spaces.
# The default is to use the ones specified in /etc/resolv.conf, but those
# might not be reachable from inside the VMs (like for example, 127.0.0.53
# from systemd-network).
